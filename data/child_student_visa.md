# Child Student Visa

## Overview

You can apply for a Child Student visa if you’re between 4 and 17 years old and you want to study at an independent school in the UK.

You must:
- Have an unconditional offer of a place on a course at an independent school
- Be able to show you’ll have access to enough money to support you in the UK and pay for your course
- Have the consent of your parent or guardian to study in the UK - you’ll need to prove this when you apply

If you’re 18 or over, apply for a Student visa instead.

This visa has replaced the Tier 4 (Child) student visa.

### When to Apply

When you can apply depends on whether you’re applying from inside or outside the UK.

#### Applying from Outside the UK

- The earliest you can apply for a visa is 6 months before you start your course.
- You’ll usually get a decision within 3 weeks.

#### Applying from Inside the UK

- The earliest you can apply is 3 months before your course starts.
- You must apply before your current visa expires.
- Your new course must begin within 28 days of your current visa expiring.
- You’ll usually get a decision within 8 weeks.

### How Long You Can Stay

How long you can stay depends on your age on the date you apply and the length of your course.

- Get public funds (benefits)
- Take a full-time permanent job or be self-employed

If your application is successful, you’ll get a full list of what you can and cannot do with a Child Student visa.

## Your Course

You must have an unconditional offer of a place on a course with a licensed Child Student sponsor.

To prove this, your education provider will send you a reference number (called a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)) once they’ve offered you a place on the course. You need a CAS before you can apply for your visa.

### Courses You Can Study

You can do a course at an independent school that’s taught in line with one of the following:
- The national curriculum
- The Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) at level 3 or below
- Independent school education inspection standards

You can also do a course that’s accepted as being at the same academic level by:
- Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted)
- Education Scotland
- Estyn (in Wales)
- Education and Training Inspectorate (in Northern Ireland)

You can do a short ‘pre-sessional’ course to prepare you for your main course.

You cannot do a foundation course that will prepare you for direct entry to a higher education institution.

### Your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS)

Once your education provider has offered you a place on a course, they’ll send you a reference number called a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS).

You’ll need to enter this reference number on your visa application.

Your CAS can cover both the pre-sessional course and your main course of study.

You must apply for your visa within 6 months of receiving your CAS.

## Money You Need

You must have enough money available to you to pay for your course and support you in the UK.

How much money you need depends on where you will live and who will be looking after you.

### If You’ll Live with Your Parent or Guardian

Your parent must have a Parent of a Child Student visa to accompany you to the UK. If you’re over 12, your parent will not be eligible, unless you have a younger sibling who’s under 12 and also has a Child Student visa.

You must have enough money to pay for your course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months).

You’ll also need £1,560 per month (for up to 9 months) - this amount is for both you and your parent.

Your parent will need an extra £625 a month (for up to 9 months) for each additional child they accompany to the UK. The child must be your sibling and must also have a Child Student visa.

### If You’re Boarding at an Independent School

You must have enough money to pay for your course fees and your boarding fees for one academic year (up to 9 months).

### If You’ll Live with a Foster Carer or Close Relative

You must have enough money to pay for your course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months).

Your foster carer or close relative must confirm they have at least £570 per month (for up to 9 months).

Your foster carer or close relative must be a British citizen or be settled (have ‘indefinite leave to remain’) in the UK. They cannot be your parent.

### If You’re 16 or 17 and Living Independently

You must have enough money to pay for your course fees for one academic year (up to 9 months).

You’ll also need either:
- £1,334 per month (for up to 9 months) if you’re studying in London
- £1,023 per month (for up to 9 months) if you’re studying outside of London

London means the City of London and the 32 London boroughs.

You must prove you (or your parent) have the money for at least 28 consecutive days. The end date of the 28-day period must be within 31 days of the date you apply for your visa.

#### Example

If you submit your application on 1 January 2021, you’d have to show that the funds were in your bank account for at least the 28-day period ending on 1 December.

If you have a student loan or financial sponsorship, you’ll need to provide evidence of this from your loan or sponsorship company.

### When You Do Not Need to Prove You Have Money to Support Yourself

You do not need to prove you have money to support yourself if you’ve had a valid UK visa for at least 12 months immediately prior to the date of your Child Student visa application - you must currently be in the UK.
